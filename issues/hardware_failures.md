# Hardware Failures Troubleshooting

This guide helps identify and address hardware issues in computers or peripherals.

## Symptoms
- Computer won’t boot or crashes frequently.
- Peripherals (keyboard, mouse) not responding.
- Overheating or unusual noises (e.g., fan grinding).

## Common Causes
- Faulty hardware components (RAM, HDD, GPU).
- Loose connections or outdated drivers.
- Overheating due to dust or poor ventilation.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check Connections**:
   - Ensure all cables (power, USB, HDMI) are secure.
   - Reseat internal components like RAM or GPU if accessible.
2. **Run Diagnostics**:
   - Windows: Use built-in Memory Diagnostic Tool or Disk Check (`chkdsk`).
   - macOS: Run Apple Diagnostics (restart and hold D key).
   - Check SMART status of drives with tools like CrystalDiskInfo.
3. **Update Drivers/Firmware**:
   - Update drivers via Device Manager (Windows) or manufacturer’s site.
   - Check for BIOS/UEFI updates.
4. **Monitor Temperatures**:
   - Use tools like HWMonitor to check CPU/GPU temps.
   - Clean dust from fans and vents with compressed air.
5. **Test Components**:
   - Swap peripherals (e.g., try a different mouse).
   - Test with a known-good power supply or RAM stick if possible.
6. **Escalate**:
   - If hardware is faulty, contact vendor for warranty or replacement.
